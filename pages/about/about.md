In early 2017 a group of people came together to discuss how best to ensure the development high-quality free and open-source software (FOSS). Coming from backgrounds in software development, business and law, they decided to form a company for that could pool funding and enter into binding contracts with developers.

By the middle of the year, the company registration documents had been submitted to incorporate RZZT CIC in the United Kingdom. It was decided that a community interest company ('CIC') would be the best way of achieving RZZT's goals while ensuring accountability and transparency. A CIC is a kind of company available in the UK for social enterprises and guarantees assets will be used for the benefit of the community.

On 7 September 2017 Companies House approved RZZT CIC's incorporation.

Initial progress was slow due to the company's youth and need to establish essential infrastructure, record-keeping systems, financial accounts, social media presence and revenue streams.

However, in December 2017 RZZT committed to supporting Taskhive, a decentralised, peer-to-peer freelance marketplace. RZZT enter into its first contract with a developer to work on the project in April 2018.
