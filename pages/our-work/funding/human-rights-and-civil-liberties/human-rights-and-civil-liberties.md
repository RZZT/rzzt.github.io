RZZT funds the development of software that protects, respects and fulfils human rights and civil liberties. But what exactly are human rights and civil liberties, and how can they be protected, respected and fulfilled?

## What are human rights?

Human rights are rights that belong to every person simply because they are human.

Human rights are diverse, and there is no definitively-agreed list.

Included among the more well-known human rights are: the right to life, liberty and security of person; the right against torture; the right against arbitrary arrest; the right to a fair trial; the right to privacy; the right against racial discrimination; and the right against sexual discrimination.

Other widely-recognised but less well-known human rights include: the right to participate in government; the right to work; the right to adequate food; the right to adequate medical care; the right to education; the right to benefit from scientific advancement; and the right to strike.

## What are civil liberties?

Civil liberties are a subset of human rights. They can be described as 'freedom-based' rights, and include the rights to freedom of expression, opinion, thought, conscience, religion, peaceful assembly, association and movement.

## Respecting, protecting and fulfilling human rights and civil liberties

_Respecting_ human rights and civil liberties means refraining from interfering with or restricting the exercise of human rights and civil liberties.

_Protecting_ human rights and civil liberties means shielding individuals and groups from human rights and civil liberties abuses.

_Fulfilling_ human rights and civil liberties means taking action to facilitate the exercise of human rights and civil liberties.

Although human rights and civil liberties typically operate as restraints and imperatives on government, the private sector can play a role in respecting, protecting and fulfilling human rights and civil liberties. This is especially important given the level of cooperation between the private sector and government, and the growth of large networked platforms for communication and commerce.

Software can respect, protect and fulfil human rights and civil liberties in a number of ways. For example:

- A blogging service can _respect_ the right to freedom of expression by having transparent and unambiguous guidelines for content moderation.
- A communications platform can _protect_ the right to privacy by ensuring communications cannot be compromised by third parties.
- An application could _fulfil_ the right to work by making it easier for workers in economically-depressed areas to find employment.

## A brief history of human rights

Beginning with the English _Bill of Rights Act 1689_, human rights made their way into the constitutional law of the liberal democracies of the 17th to 19th centuries. During the 19th and early 20th century, human rights slowly became part of international law.

After the Second World War, the need and demand for the international recognition and protection of human rights became increasingly apparent. Work on an 'International Bill of Rights' began in 1947 under the auspices of the newly-formed United Nations.

Drawing on the constitutions of liberal democracies and the ideas of philosophers, Eleanor Roosevelt, John Humphrey and Rene Cassin prepared the _Universal Declaration of Human Rights_ (UDHR), was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948 and is the foundation of modern international human rights law.

## Modern human rights instruments
