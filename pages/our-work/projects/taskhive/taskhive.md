RZZT has committed to providing financial backing for <a href="https://taskhive.io">Taskhive</a>, a decentralised peer-to-peer freelance marketplace.

When finished, Taskhive will help connect freelancers and clients, provide guarantees of payment and completion, and be completely free to use.

Taskhive emphasises individual choice in trade and commerce, allows users to control their personal information, and will protect privacy, resist censorship, promote trust, and allow users to build reputations.

In December 2017 RZZT began discussing the development priorities with Taskhive's project management, with the view of entering into a contract with a developer.

After lengthy discussions, RZZT formed a contract with a developer in April 2018 for 12 weeks' of work on Taskhive.
