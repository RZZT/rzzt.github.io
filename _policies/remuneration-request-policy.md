## Introduction

This document sets out the policy and procedure for requesting remuneration from the Company for expenses incurred in connection with Company activities.

## Definitions

In this policy:

- an '**approved expense**' is an expense that was approved by the Directors before it was incurred;
- an '**authorised person**' is a person who is authorised by the Directors to remunerate persons for expenses incurred in connection with Company activities;
- a '**receipt**' includes receipts, paid invoices, payment confirmations, and similar documents authenticating payment; and
- an '**unapproved expense**' is an expense that was not approved by the Directors before it was incurred.

## Remuneration generally

1. A person may request remuneration for an approved expense or an unapproved expense.
2. A remuneration request must have annexed to it a receipt equal to the amount of remuneration requested.
2. A person may request remuneration for multiple expenses in the same request, provided that:
    1. the request is itemised; and
    2. annexed to the request are receipts equalling in total the amount of remuneration requested.
3. A person may request remuneration for a combination of approved expenses and unapproved expenses at the same time.

## Remuneration for approved expenses

1. An authorised person may remunerate a person for an approved expense if:
    1. the amount of remuneration requested does not exceed the amount approved by the Directors; and
    2. all annexed receipts appear to the authorised person to be genuine.
2. An authorised person must only remunerate a person for the lower amount of:
    1. the amount approved by the Directors; or
    2. the total actual expenses evidenced by the annexed receipts.
3. If a person's expenses exceed the amount approved by the Directors, they may request remuneration for the excess amount as an unapproved expense.

## Remuneration for unapproved expenses

1. The Directors may direct an authorised person to remunerate a person for an unapproved expense.
2. An authorised person must not remunerate a person unless directed to do so by the Directors.
