## Introduction

This document sets out the policy and procedures for granting Company email addresses and the creation and maintenance of mailing lists.

## Definitions

In this process:

- '**a Company email address**' means an email address associated with the Company's domain name; and
- '**Officer**' means a Director or a Company Secretary of the Company.

## Email addresses

1. Every Officer shall be assigned a Company email address as soon as is practicable after being appointed to the relevant office.
2. Email addresses shall consist of:
    1. the Officer's forename; or
    2. forename and surname if necessary for distinction; or
    3. a preferred nickname appropriate for a professional environment.
3. A person's access to an assigned email address shall be revoked not less than 28 days after that person ceases to be an Officer.
4. An email address that has had access to it revoked shall not be re-assigned to another person unless a period of two years has elapsed from when the access was revoked.

## Permanent mailing lists

1. The following permanent mailing lists shall exist:
    1. members@;
    2. officers@;
    3. directors@; and
    4. secretary@.
2. The members@ mailing list shall consist only of all Members of the Company, using the email address they provided when they applied for membership.
3. The officers@ mailing list shall consist only of all Officers of the Company, using the Company email addresses assigned to them.
4. The directors@ mailing list shall consist only of all Directors of the Company, using the Company email addresses assigned to them.
5. The secretary@ mailing list shall consist only of all Company Secretaries of the Company, using the Company email addresses assigned to them.
6. All permanent mailing lists must be able to receive messages from Members and Officers of the Company.
7. All permanent mailing lists apart from the members@ mailing list must be able to receive messages from persons other than Members and Officers.

## Ad hoc mailing lists

1. A new ad hoc mailing list shall be created upon the establishment of a new committee.
2. The address of an ad hoc mailing list must take into consideration the often competing needs for unambiguity and brevity, such as:
    1. fundingcommittee@ for the Funding Committee; or
    2. prcommittee@ for the Public Relations and Marketing Committee.
3. An ad hoc mailing list shall consist only of all persons who are members of the relevant committee.
4. All ad hoc mailing lists must be able to receive messages from Officers.
