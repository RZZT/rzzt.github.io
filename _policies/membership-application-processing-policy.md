## Introduction

This document sets out the process for applying for membership of the Company, and how applications are to be processed by the relevant officers of the Company.

## Definitions

In this process:

- 'applicant' means a person who has or intends to apply for membership of the Company;

## Process

4. If the Company Secretary determines that the membership application form has been correctly completed, the Company Secretary must inform the applicant that the application will be referred to the Directors for consideration, and advise the applicant of the date of the next Directors' meeting if that date is known.
5. If the Company Secretary determines that the membership application form has been correctly completed, the Company Secretary must refer the application to the Directors for their consideration, and advise the Directors as to whether any of the information provided by the applicant would preclude the applicant from membershop of the Company.
6. The Company Secretary shall promptly inform an applicant of the outcome of their application, unless the applicant was in attendance at the meeting at which the determination of their application was made.
7. If an applicant's application was successful, the Company Secretary shall promptly record the applicant's details in the Register of Members, and include the applicant's nominated email address in the relevant email group.
