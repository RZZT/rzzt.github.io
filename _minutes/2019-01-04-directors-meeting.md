## Promotional campaign strategy

Matthew raised the possibility of giving small donations to FOSS developers in order to raise the Company's profile.

Matthew also said that donating hardware such as Arduinos and Raspberry Pis to schools in developing nations could raise the Company's profile.

The Directors resolved to refer the matter to the Company Secretary and Akhilesh Jamdar (not present) for examination of any legal ramifications associated with donating hardware.
