## CIC Report

The Company Secretary reminded the directors that a Community Interest Company Report (Companies House Form CIC 34) is due each year, and that a report made up to 30 September 2018 would be due with the Company's accounts by the end of June 2019.

The Company Secretary suggested the directors ensure that they are satisfied with the Company's activities and achievements for the year, and implement any plans they want to be included in the 2018/19 CIC Report before 1 October 2018, particularly in regard to the Company's education and awards goals.

## Confirmation Statement

The Company Secretary reminded the directors that the Company is required to file a Confirmation Statement by 20 September 2018, and confirmed that he is taking care of the matter.

The Directors noted that the Confirmation Statement will be filed online at a cost of £13, significantly lower than the £40 filing fee if filed in paper form.

## Project funding

The Directors confirmed that funding for the Taskhive project has ceased and will not resume until the project has clear direction. The Directors felt that the Company had provided sufficient funding to progress the project, but that the project faced technical restrictions that had to be surmounted before further funding could be committed.

The Directors noted that they were open to considering supplying funding for other projects where there were adequately concrete plans and achievable goals.

## Educational materials

The Directors noted the importance of making educational materials available as part of the Company's goals, and determined that arrangements would be made to publish such materials on the Company's website.
