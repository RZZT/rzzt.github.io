## Application for membership

The Directors noted that an application for membership had been received from Neal Wright.

The Directors decided to vote on this outside the meeting to give Akhilesh the opportunity to vote.

## Minutes

The Directors confirmed that the minutes up to and including the General Meeting of 9 February 2019 are accurate and current.

## Introducing action items

Mozart proposed that matters to be actioned by one or more Directors be noted as action items in the minutes, to be reviewed at each subsequent meeting.

This was affirmed by the Directors.

## Business cards

Mozart proposed that Matthew circulate a design for Directors' business cards for the Directors to approve the design and funding for 100 business cards per Director.

Subject to approval, the design shall consist of:

- The Director's name, position, phone number and email address; and the Company's website address and logo on the front of the card.
- The text: 'RZZT is a community interest company dedicated to funding free and open-source software that protects, respects and fulfills human rights and civil liberties' on the back of the card.

The Directors accepted Vistaprint as the proposed printer, subject to approval of the design.

## Committees

Mozart indicated he would like to explore disbanding the committees in favour of more flexible arrangements.

The Directors decided to discuss the matter further between this and the next meeting.

## Public relations manager

Mozart proposed that Joseph Olbrycht-Palmer, currently a member of the Public Relations and Marketing Committee, be given the role of Public Relations Manager, with a greater degree of autonomy over the Company's public relations management.

The Directors decided to discuss the matter further between this and the next meeting, with a document outlining the scope of the position to be drafted by Mozart.

## Member contributions

The Directors decided to discuss with the members what contributions the members feel they can make to the Company, including identifying what needs the Company has that could be addressed by members.

## Statement of human rights and civil liberties

The Directors decided that Mozart shall create a statement outlining the more common and significant human rights and civil liberties based on the nine core United Nations human rights instruments, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and comparable regional instruments, for publication on the website to explain what human rights and civil liberties are, and why they are important.

## Updating Companies House

Mozart (as Company Secretary) will provide Matthew with the Company's updated Articles of Association, the Special Resolutions passed at the General Meeting, a cover letter, and any other documents required to be sent to Companies House as a consequence of the General Meeting of 9 February 2019.

Matthew will send these documents to Companies House by priority post as soon as possible.
