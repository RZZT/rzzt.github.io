## Decisions made prior to the meeting

The Directors confirmed that there are no outstanding decisions that need to be minuted, but several decisions are pending.

## Membership application change

**The Directors decided** that a requirement be inserted in the membership application form that an applicant include the name and email address of a current member who endorses the application.

## Susan Sons' resignation from the Funding Committee

- The Directors noted that Susan Sons had resigned from the Funding Committee due to other commitments. The Directors thanked Susan for her contributions and wished her well in her future endeavours.
- The Directors noted that Susan's resignation creates a vacancy on the Funding Committee, and that the Committee is, in accordance with its terms of reference, unable to make decisions without a replacement.
- The Directors noted that proposed amendments to the Funding Committee terms of reference have been circulated, creating flexibility in who may be appointed, but that a replacement will need to be found regardless.

## Committee reports

- The Directors noted the receipt of the Public Relations and Marketing Committee's monthly report.
- The Directors excused the Funding Committee from producing a monthly report due to limited progress.
- Matthew informed the Directors that the Public Relations and Marketing Committee:
- is in the process of creating and updating social media accounts (Twitter and Facebook);
- is undertaking a redesign of the website and improving the content;
- has created and adopted a style guide;
- is in the process of designing merchandise;
- has recommended soliciting donations and merchandising as primary means of income; and
- is continuing efforts to expand the Committee.
- Akhilesh informed the Directors that the Funding Committee:
- has been looking into potential corporate sponsors, with limited success; and
- intends to change its focus to alternative ways of raising money.

## Harassment and discrimination law compliance

- The Directors acknowledged that, to the best of their knowledge and understanding, the Company is in compliance with British law on harassment and discrimination.
- The Directors noted that a policy on harassment and discrimination:
- is preferable, especially if the Company continues to expand; and
- may help to reduce the Company's liability, along with other steps to prevent harassment and discrimination from occurring.
- Akhilesh noted that British harassment and discrimination laws appear to be relatively lax in order not to hinder business, but that:
- it would be ethically appropriate to have a policy;
- a policy would assist in respecting the rights of members; and
- a policy would benefit the Company's public relations.
- **The Directors decided** that Akhilesh would be best-suited to begin drafting a policy on harassment and discrimination, in consultation with the other Directors.

## Fundraising and merchandising status

- The Directors noted the need to secure consistent and reliable funding streams.
- **The Directors decided** to pursue the establishment of a bespoke online store for merchandise.

## Lack of progress towards objects in Articles of Association

- The Directors noted that there has been limited progress towards the educational and awards objects in the Articles of Association.
- **The Directors decided** to pursue the publication of educational articles and other materials on the website.
