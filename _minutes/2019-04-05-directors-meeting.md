## Previous meeting action items

Mozart confirmed that he had completed the three action items assigned to him at the [previous meeting](https://rzzt.io/minutes/2019-03-29-directors-meeting.html#action-items)

## Matt's resignation

The Directors noted that Matthew Ferrero had resigned as a Director of the Company.

The Directors thanked Matt for his service as a founding Director of RZZT CIC, and wished him the best for any of his future endeavours.

## Appointment of Managing Director

The Directors decided not to appoint Mozart to role of Managing Director because he would be required to vote for himself for the decision to be made. Instead, this matter will be dealt with at the General Meeting.

## Meeting schedule

The Directors decided to set the meeting schedule to be an hour later than currently. Directors' meetings will now be held on Fridays at 03:00 UTC.

## Action items

- Mozart will email the members about Matt's resignation as a Director and note that new Directors can be proposed at the general meeting of 13 April.
- Akhilesh will investigate the email received by Hatch Enterprise
