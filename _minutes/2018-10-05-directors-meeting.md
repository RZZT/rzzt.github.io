## Email to members

The Directors noted that Matthew had sent an email to the members inviting opinions on where to direct funding.

Matthew requested the opinions of those present in their capacity as members.

Victor said his opinion was that the Company should consider funding projects with fewer technical challenges than Taskhive.

Mozart agreed with Victor and said his opinion was that the Company should consider funding a less ambitious project than Taskhive.

Matthew concurred with the above opinions.

## Funding allocation

**The Directors decided** that, pending further responses from members to the email, each Director would suggest between 5 and 10 projects for consideration for funding at the next meeting.

## Committee vacancies

The Directors noted that there remains a vacancy on the Funding Committee, and that the Public Relations and Marketing Committee would benefit from additional members.

The Directors determined that they would pursue options for advertising for these positions before the next meeting.
