## Taskhive progress

The Directors noted that the alpha version of the Taskhive project was nearly complete and would be ready for testing shortly.

## Increasing membership

The Directors noted that currently there are six members, and an even number of members is undesirable because:

- all three Directors are also members, meaning that the remaining members would not be able to achieve a majority exercise their reserve power against the Directors effectively; and
- an even number of members can result in an equality of votes.

Matthew noted that this should not result in increasing membership for the sake of it, but at least one suitable candidate should be found.
