Matt confirmed he had provided his details for the business cards.

Matt confirmed that the [postage proposal](https://rzzt.io/minutes/2019-03-08-directors-meeting.html#postage-from-within-the-uk) is the cheapest and most efficient way of handling outgoing post within the United Kingdom and said he would circulate a vote after the meeting.

Mozart confirmed that he had created an email account for Joseph Olbrycht-Palmer, following Joseph's appointment as Public Relations Manager.

Mozart confirmed that he had circulated Neal Wright's CV among the Directors.

## Submitting paperwork to Companies House

Mozart confirmed that the paperwork required to be filed with Companies House regarding amendments to the Company's articles had been delivered to his contact in the United Kingdom, and will be promptly posted to Companies House.

Mozart noted that it took an unreasonable amount of time for the other Directors to sign and return form CIC14.

## Discord to Slack

The Directors confirmed the decision to transition from Discord to Slack, which is to be be complete by 4 April.

## Reschedule Directors' meeting

The Directors noted that Akhilesh had raised the matter of rescheduling Directors' meetings due to his poor health, but was not present to discuss the matter.

## Letter from the members

The Directors confirmed that they had received a letter from three of the Company's seven Members outlining various grievances and proposing a restructure of the Company.

The Directors thanked those members for the letter and noted that they would respond to it shortly.

Mozart noted implementing some of the requests would require a general meeting to amend the Articles of Association, and volunteered to assist with preparing a request for a general meeting and a special resolution.
