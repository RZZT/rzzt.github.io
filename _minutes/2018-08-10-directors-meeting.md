## Funding Committee applicant

Matthew noted that the Company Secretary had forwarded an application to join the Funding Committee from a colleague of Akhilesh's. He requested that Akhilesh arrange a short online or telephone interview between the applicant and the Directors.

## Taskhive contract renewal

Matthew noted that Victor, in his former capacity as a contractor of the Company, had previously advised that Bitmessage is inadequate as a base for the Taskhive project. Victor confirmed that an expert on networking and decentralised systems should be consulted to determine an alternative.

**The Directors decided** to investigate suitable options for an expert consultant to resolve the discussed issues, with a view to determining a cost estimate.
