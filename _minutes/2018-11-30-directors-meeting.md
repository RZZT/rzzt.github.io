## Trello

Matthew informed the Directors that he had set up Trello boards for Company officers and members, and explained how they can be accessed.

## Member engagement

Matthew expressed his desire to see more active engagement of the membership in Company affairs.

The Company Secretary noted that lack of engagement could be due to one or more factors, including a perceived lack of progress, a lack of interest, or a lack of time.

The Company Secretary also noted that membership engagement is not strictly necessary, that the Directors are the primary executive organ of the Company, and that the members can exercise their reserve powers if they feel the Directors are poorly managing the Company.

## Donation application form

Matthew informed the Directors that the donation application form is nearing completion.
