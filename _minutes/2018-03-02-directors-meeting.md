## Developer contract draft

The Directors noted that the Funding Committee had, as requested, produced a draft independent contractor agreement for developers.

The Company Secretary explained, for the purposes of clarity, that it is a standard independent contractor agreement, and had been adapted from an existing contract that the Funding Committee determined was a suitable starting point.

## Taskhive development

Matthew noted that the Directors were in discussions with representatives of the Taskhive project as to what areas of development should be prioritised.

## PayPal

The Company Secretary confirmed to the Directors that he was still attempting to remove limitations on the Company's PayPal account, but was having difficulty because:

- PayPal's online forms require residential and identity information, but will only accept UK residential details; and
- PayPal is requesting details on beneficial owners but, because there are none, a senior management official is deemed sufficient, however there is no ability to add or remove officials.

## Funding Officer availability

Matthew noted that Akhilesh had previously indicated increased commitments that could make it difficult for him to fulfil his role as Funding Officer. Matthew stated he would discuss this with Akhilesh and determine whether the Funding Committee will require additional assistance.
