## Funding Committee membership

The Directors noted that a proposal for a decision without a meeting to appoint Susan Sons to the Funding Committee had been circulated, and was awaiting the response of Akhilesh, unanimous agreement being necessary and Matthew and Victor having already given their agreement.

## Taskhive progress

**The Directors decided** that they would discuss with the leader of the Taskhive project whether further developers are currently needed and, if so, in which areas they are needed.

## Statement of human rights

The Directors noted that a proposal for a decision without a meeting had been circulated for the Company to adopt a statement of human rights, but that the Directors disagreed on which version of the statement should be adopted and consequently the requirement of unanimous consent had not been met.

## Documents to be published

The Directors noted that a proposed list of documents to be published by the Company Secretary had been circulated for a decision without a meeting.

**The Directors decided** that, if the proposed list of documents was adopted, the Company Secretary may publish documents in batches at least once a month, with the exception of minutes, which must be published expeditiously after every meeting.
