## Company accounts

Matthew reminded the Directors that, in accordance with the Company's legal obligations and the relevant resolution passed at the Directors' meeting on 17 September 2017, the Company Secretary maintains records of all assets, liabilities, income and expenses owned, received or incurred by the Company. These accounts may be perused by the Directors at their leisure.

## Profiles on website

The Directors discussed including profiles and photographs of each Director on the Company's website. Matthew and Akhilesh agreed that this would improve the professional appearance and credibility of the Company; Victor disagreed.

Matthew suggested that one or more officers or persons associated with the Company could act as spokespersons for the Company on a voluntary basis.

The Directors discussed the possibility of each Director providing as much or as little information for a profile on the Company's website as they felt appropriate on an individual basis.

No decision was taken on either matter.

## Offer of a server

Michael Mackenzie, a member of the Company, had prior to the meeting made the offer of providing access to a server to the Company. Michael informed the Directors that this offer stands, and that the server could be used for whatever Company-related purposes the Directors saw fit.

**The Directors decided** that a server was not needed at present, but thanked Michael for his offer.

## Funding and allocation of funds

The Directors acknowledged that the Company currently has limited funds. Michael stated his view that the Company should aim to secure a reliable source or sources of income rather than being reliant on a trickle income from donations.

Matthew suggested that his earlier suggestion of having a spokesperson or spokespersons, whose responsibilities could include securing sources of income on behalf of the Company. Matthew also floated the idea of using volunteers to promote the Company and its ideals more widely.

The Directors agreed that a reliable source of independent income is necessary for growth.

The Directors acknowledged that the Company Secretary opened a PayPal account in accordance with the relevant resolution at the Directors' meeting on 17 September 2017. The Directors noted that arrangements for joint-access to the PayPal account need to be made.

In regard to funding of projects by the Company, the Directors agreed that projects should not be nebulous and that before funding is given a project must have shown concrete project. The Directors also agreed that the funding of projects should wait until the Company is definitely able to cover its operating costs, but that it is appropriate to commence the drafting of forms and guidelines for projects to apply for funding.

**The Directors decided** that Matthew will draft a form for project developers to apply for funding from the Company and associated guidelines which will be subject to final approval by the Directors.

## Promotional material

The Directors expressed a desire to adopt a document that declares the Company's principles.

**The Directors decided** that Akhilesh will draft a statement of principles for the Company based on the [Mozilla Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/details/) and with appropriate modifications which will be subject to final approval by the Directors.

## Sustainability and publicity

Matthew floated the idea of eventually having a flagship project that the Company sponsors, which would especially help to focus advertising efforts. It was agreed that once the Company has successfully funded a project to completion it will be able to expand into additional projects.
