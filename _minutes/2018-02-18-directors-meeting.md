## Funding Committee progress

The Funding Committee was directed to provide a progress report to the Directors at or before the next meeting.

## PayPal access

The Directors noted that it was desirable for multiple officers to have access to the Company's PayPal account, and to require multiple authorisations for funds to be paid out. The Company Secretary confirmed that multi-user access to PayPal is possible and can be arranged, but was unsure whether multiple authorisations is possible.

## Taskhive developer contracts

The Directors acknowledged that Victor Rincones Rodriguez is currently the lead developer of the Taskhive project, which the Company previously resolved to fund, pending the negotiation and entering into of a contract with a suitable developer.

Matthew proposed that, given Victor's familiarity with and knowledge of the Taskhive project, the Company should attempt to negotiate a contract with Victor.

The Directors acknowledged that Victor has a conflict of interest concerning this matter, and as such is not permitted to vote upon or unduly influence any decision concerning this matter.

In the absence of Akhilesh, the Directors deferred this matter until after appropriate discussions between all Directors had taken place, and until such time as a valid decision could be made.

## Meeting times and dates

The Directors noted that Akhilesh had, prior to the meeting, suggested that meetings be moved from Sundays at 02:30 UTC±0 to Sundays at 14:00 or 15:00 UTC±0. Victor suggested that the meetings be moved to Sundays at 16:00 or 17:00 UTC±0.

Mozart reminded the Directors that either option would fall between 1:00 am and 4:00 am in Sydney, and is thus likely to preclude his attendance.

Matthew stated his indifference to the date and time, but expressed his desire for meetings to be at a regular date and time, and for that date and time to remain unchanged for a substantial period.

No decision was made on this matter pending further discussion.

## Communications platforms

Mike suggested that the Company switch to a communications platform other than, but similar to, Slack or IRC. The Directors agreed that Mike should present possible alternatives to them between now and the next meeting.

It was noted that alternatives would require the Company to self-host the platforms, and that Mike had offered to host an alternative on behalf of the Company.
