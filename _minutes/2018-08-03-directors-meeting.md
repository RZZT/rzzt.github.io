Matthew noted that the meeting was not quorate and that consequently no decisions could be made. He requested that the Company SecretaryÂ minute his statements.

## Future Taskhive contracts

Matthew wished it to be noted that it is the general opinion of the Directors that, before a new contract is agreed to continue development of Taskhive, a technical review or consultation of the codebase the project uses must be conducted by an appropriately-qualified person.

## Committee membership

Matthew wished it to be noted that:

- he has been actively searching for suitable candidates to join the Public Relations and Marketing Committee so that there are sufficient members to implement a public relations campaign; and
- he has attempted to contact an applicant to join the Funding Committee, requesting a short interview with available Directors.

The Company Secretary asked Matthew whether Matthew has updated the website to advertise for the Public Relations and Marketing Committee. Matthew said that he had not, and would do so shortly.

## Website content

Matthew wished it to be noted that he has been preparing additional website content but has not yet uploaded any changes. He has focused on the awards and education section.

Matthew expressed concern over the quality of the content he has produced. The Company Secretary reminded him that this is within the remit of the Public Relations and Marketing Committee, who can review and edit content if it is provided.
