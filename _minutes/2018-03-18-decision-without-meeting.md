To change the Company's primary communications from Slack to Discord, with the following stipulations:

- Discord must remain the Company's primary communications platform for a period of at least 12 months from its adoption;
- in the event that Discord becomes completely unusable (for technical reasons outside their control) for any one member of RZZT, the Company will switch to using IRC, and IRC will remain the primary communications platform for a period of at least 12 months; and
- whether or not there is a switch, all members who use IRC are responsible for recording and maintaining their own discussion logs, as informal discussions made over IRC are not the responsibility of RZZT to maintain or log.
