Software is an integral part of modern life, being a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment, and society as a whole.

Software should enrich the lives of its users.

Free and open-source software promotes and protects the freedoms of its users, and allows them to contribute to and shape the software they use.

Decentralised software is robust and resistant against interference from malicious actors.

The effectiveness of software is improved through interoperability, innovation, and decentralised participation worldwide.

Transparent, community-based processes promote participation, accountability and trust.

Software should be commercialised without compromising user rights and public benefits.

Increasing the public benefit derived from free and open-source software is an important goal worthy of time, attention and commitment.
