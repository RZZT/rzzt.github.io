## Taskhive

RZZT officially supports <a href="https://taskhive.io/">Taskhive</a>, a decentralised peer-to-peer freelance marketplace. RZZT is currently in discussions with the project's coordinators to determine priorities for development, with a view to engaging a developer or developers to work on the project.

When completed, Taskhive will be a feeless marketplace in which users can offer to buy or sell services. Its focuse is on decentralisation of technology and individual choice in trade and commerce.

Taskhive will empower freelancers and their clients, while allowing them to control their personal information. Combined with the decentralised approach, Taskhive will protect privacy and resist censorship, while including mechanisms to promote trust and build user reputations.
