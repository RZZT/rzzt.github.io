Matthew Ferrero has stepped down as a Director of RZZT CIC.

Mr Ferrero said his resignation was due to personal reasons and left the door open to further work with the Company.

The Board of Directors said it is not rushing to fill the vacancy, but added that a new Director could be proposed at the next general meeting, scheduled for [13 April 2019](https://rzzt.io/announcement/general%20meeting/2019/03/29/general-meeting.html).

An amendment to the Company's Articles of Association is currently under consideration that would expand the size of the Board, and a new Managing Director position has been created, which will be filled after ongoing consultation with the Company's members.
