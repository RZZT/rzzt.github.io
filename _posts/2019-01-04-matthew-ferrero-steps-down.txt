Matthew Ferrero has stepped down from his role as director.

Mr Ferrero said his resignation was due to personal reasons and left the door open to further work with the company.

The Board said it is not rushing to fill the vacancy but that a new director could be proposed at the next general meeting.

An amendment to the company’s Articles of Association is currently under consideration to expand the size of the Board and a new managing director position has been opened.
