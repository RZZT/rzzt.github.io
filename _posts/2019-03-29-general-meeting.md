Dear Members of RZZT CIC,

Please be advised that the Company will hold a general meeting online via IRC on Saturday 13 April 2019 at 06:00 UTC (see below for time zone conversions).

The meeting is open to all Members of the Company.

As with all Company meetings, it will be held in the channel #RZZT-meetings on chat.freenode.net. Please contact [secretary@rzzt.io](mailto:secretary@rzzt.io) if you need assistance in accessing that channel.

At the general meeting Members will vote on one (1) special resolutions to amend the Company's Articles of Association. Other business may also be conducted at the general meeting in accordance with the Articles of Association and any applicable legislation.

The list of special resolutions being proposed is [available here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/documents/RZZT-Draft-Special-Resolutions-2019-04-13.pdf) (PDF).

Members may appoint a proxy to vote or nominate on their behalf if they are unable to attend the meeting, and may instruct the proxy regarding how they wish to vote. If you wish to do this, please complete the [proxy appointment form]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/documents/RZZT-Proxy-Appointment-Form-2019-04-13.pdf) (PDF) and email it to [secretary@rzzt.io](mailto:secretary@rzzt.io).

After each special resolution is formally proposed, members will be asked to respond with 'aye', 'nay' or 'abstain'. The Chair of the meeting shall duly close the vote and declare the result.
