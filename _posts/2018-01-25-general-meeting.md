Dear members of RZZT CIC,

Pleased be advised that the Company will hold a general meeting online via IRC on Saturday 9 February 2019 at 07:00 UTC (see below for time zone conversions).

The meeting is open to all members of the Company.

As with all Company meetings, it will be held in the channel #RZZT-meetings on chat.freenode.net. Please contact [secretary@rzzt.io](mailto:secretary@rzzt.io) if you need assistance in accessing that channel.

At the general meeting members will vote on eight (8) special resolutions to amend the Company's Articles of Association, and elect one (1) Director following the resignation of VÃ­ctor Rincones Rodriguez, which will take effect on Monday 11 February 2019.
